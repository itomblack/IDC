			<h3>4.</br>Best-In-Class Chat</h3>

			<!-- <p>Short projects can be a fun time to explore new processes. Want to scrape the App Store review data? Why not see if there's a Python script for that? But beware, entering into new territory can also be a waste of time. It’s important to quickly identify when to pivot. Sometimes a bit of manual labour, like taking lots of screenshots, will do the trick.</p> -->

	<!-- 		<p>Don't design in isolation. Just because you only have to show one screen, you should still consider its place within the wider experience. Rough sketches are fine initially, but you'll want to clean it up in Sketch for the final presentation. Not everyone can understand your scribbles or handwriting. Did I say not everyone? I meant nobody.</p> -->

			<h3>8.</br>Object Mapping</h3>

		<!-- 	<p>Before you begin drawing a mysterious collection of carefully organised rectangles, think about what you’re actually attempting to communicate. What are the most important messages or pieces of information? Is there a hierarchy? Now you’ve figured that out, test out ways to organise it visually. Iteration is your friend here.</p> -->
